 returns a static semaphore of eight resources intended to restrain parallelity when dispatching events with this service
 
 @Discussion
 We had instances where the Facebook parser service hung up on us when about 60 some parallel requests were issued
 (this might correlate with the fact that all Facebook requests reach out to the internet).
 
 Going beyond eight parallel resources did not seem to gain any better performance on any of the parsers.
